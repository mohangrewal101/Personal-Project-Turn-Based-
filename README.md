# Personal-Project-Turn-Based-
Turn-based project, based in Unity
NOTES:

General:
- Enemy Stats UI and Player Stats UI are done, access it by clicking on the enemy or player (including moving health bars)
- Items button is clickable, but no items have been made for the player inventory yet, it's still all being tested out so please ignore the inventory and items. 
(You can look at the code I have been doing for it, but keep in mind that it is a work in progress)
- Please ignore the other scene (for now I am not working on it)
- All Player and Skeleton sprite animations, Background, and the Pixelated font for my UI have been taken from online (I am not a great artist)
- Everything else was drawn by me, including the tiles, Attack UI, Magic UI, Item UI, and Skeleton Stats UI

Future Plans (in order of most importance to least important):
- Add different types of items to the inventory, make an enemy inventory
- Add post-processing and lighting effects
- Work on adding a random amount of enemies each time the player starts the game
- Work on more enemies to add to the game
- Add an animation for the Player Fire Animation
- Work on more player entities to add to the game
- Make the combat system more intricate


On Hiatus (in other words it's not currently being worked on):
- The Out-Of-Battle scene
